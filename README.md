# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis
### The purpose of this Analysis was to assist Steve with helping his parents analyze different stocks to invest in.I as able to perform an analysis of stock “DQ” but also compare other stocks similarly by their rate of return and Daily Volume in the years 2017 and 2018.

## Results:
### DQ’s volume increase from 136,070,900 to 107, 873,900 from 2017 to 2018 showing that transactions among this stock increased sharply in one year. The rate of return was the highest in year 2017 at 199.4%. 2018 seemed like a down year in the market as most companies were showing a negative rate of return in 2018. The highest rate of return year over year went to stock “ENPH”. “ENPH” had great return in both years with a substantial volume increase year over. DQ was one of the better performers year over year but “ENPH” performance was the best and should be the stock to pick if we are grading these stocks from the two-year timespan.

### Initially when we ran the script, we used a nested formula in our code, and it ran fast. However, when we refactored the code and removed the nested loop, we are achieving the same outcome but at a faster rate. You can see that with the images below.

## Advantages refactoring code
### The advantage of refactoring code allows you to have a faster output and, in my mind, an easier code to read. Nested loops can make your code a bit confusing at times and if someone were to send you over their work with nested loops it can lead to you taking more time to understand the other person’s work.

## Disadvantages
### The disadvantage of refactoring code is that it takes time and effort to find a better way to refactor the code.

## Conlusion of refactoring code
### In conclusion the pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script by understanding how much time and effort you want to put in. Refactoring code can potentially be beneficial and quicker output time but it will take time to refactor the code in VBA to come up with a better solution.
